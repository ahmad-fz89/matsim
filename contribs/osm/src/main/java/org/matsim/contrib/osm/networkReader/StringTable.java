		 * When a string is referenced, strings in the string table with
		 * indices: 0 : Is reserved (used as a delimiter in tags A: 1 to 127 :
		 * Uses can be represented with 1 byte B: 128 to 128**2-1 : Uses can be
		 * represented with 2 bytes, C: 128*128 to X : Uses can be represented
		 * with 3 bytes in the unlikely case we have >16k strings in a block. No
		 * block will contain enough strings that we'll need 4 bytes.
		 *
		 * There are goals that will improve compression: 1. I want to use 1
		 * bytes for the most frequently occurring strings, then 2 bytes, then 3
		 * bytes. 2. I want to use low integers as frequently as possible (for
		 * better entropy encoding out of deflate) 3. I want the string table to
		 * compress as small as possible.
		 *
		 * Condition 1 is obvious. Condition 2 makes deflate compress string
		 * table references more effectively. When compressing entities, delta
		 * coding causes small positive integers to occur more frequently than
		 * larger integers. Even though a string table references to indices of
		 * 1 and 127 both use one byte in a decompressed file, the small integer
		 * bias causes deflate to use fewer bits to represent the smaller index
		 * when compressed. Condition 3 is most effective when adjacent strings
		 * in the string table have a lot of common substrings.
		 *
		 * So, when I decide on the master string table to use, I put the 127
		 * most frequently occurring strings into A (accomplishing goal 1), and
		 * sort them by frequency (to accomplish goal 2), but for B and C, which
		 * contain the less progressively less frequently encountered strings, I
		 * sort them lexicographically, to maximize goal 3 and ignoring goal 2.
		 *
		 * Goal 1 is the most important. Goal 2 helped enough to be worth it,
		 * and goal 3 was pretty minor, but all should be re-benchmarked.
